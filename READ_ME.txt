Notes for grading:

Combining 2 functional lights on the same geometry:
Best visible on the cubes visible in the right side viewport or behind the left side.
Directional light + point light + spotlight occasionally hits the cubes
(I had this one last milestone just forgot to have it checked for grading)


Lights demonstrate proper specular:
Again visible on the same cube as the last part, the left one has specular + normal map
The right one has just a normal map. 
Specular is more visible when you get closer and can see the details in the rock

Multiple viewport scenes
Pretty obvious but the camera is changed in both of them when you move.
It's the same scene just rendered from different views to the viewports
